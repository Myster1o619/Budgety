1. controller.init() - initialize the program
	=> setupEventListeners();
	
2. User enters:
- type of input - expense or income
- description for the input
- total for the input

Input is gathered using DOM manipulation
input is stored in DOMStrings (UIController)
DOMStrings made accessible via getDOMStrings function

3. input is added and stored via ctrlAddItem();

4. ctrlAddItem() = function

declares variables: input 
input gets the data from getInput() (simply returns DOM manipulation data)

a newItem is created

5. newItem = budgetCtrl.addItem(input.type, input.description, input.value)
data from DOM manipulation is stored in the budgetController

6. addItem receives input.type, input.description, input.value
(addItem is in budgetController)

7. addItem function with 3 arguments (type, des, val)
type relates to income or expense

2 new variables declared:

newItem and ID
Once newItem is created with ID, either new Expense or new Income is created
Expense and Income have id, description, value

8. budgetController declares variable 'data' - which is an object

data contain an object allItems which is an object storing
2 more objects, which are arrays 
These array store all expenses and all incomes

9 when an item is added via addItem, a new ID for the item (income/expense)
is created:

if there are no items (be it income or expense) in the allItems array,
the ID for the newly added item is set to zero

if there ARE items in the array (be in income or expense) then the ID
for the newly added item is calculated

10. in the addItem function (type, des, val)

if type === 'exp' a new Expense item is created
if type === 'inc' a new Income item is created

11. this new item is then added to the relevant array

12. this new item is returned
